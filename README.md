## Installation

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still a work in progress

#### Arch Linux:

Thank you to [@rwinkhart](https://github.com/rwinkhart) for publishing the AUR Package!  
AUR: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nova-music-git

#### Compile it yourself for any platform:

A [justfile](./justfile) is included by default for the [casey/just][just] command runner.

- `just` builds the application with the default `just build-release` recipe
- `just run` builds and runs the application
- `just install` installs the project into the system
- `just vendor` creates a vendored tarball
- `just build-vendored` compiles with vendored dependencies from that tarball
- `just check` runs clippy on the project to check for linter warnings
- `just check-json` can be used by IDEs that support LSP

## Updates

- Playlists now stored in local data directory as utf8 m3u files.
- Creating a playlist allows you to choose and icon to display. (Filepath to icon is saved in the M3U)
- When scanning the music directory, Nova Music will detect m3u files and make a personal copy in the local data
  directory.
- The user is now notified in the case of most errors rather than doing nothing or crashing.
- All the text in the app is now utilizing localization with i18n so translations are now possible.

## Todo:

#### Priority:

- Exploring CPAL instead of Rodio
- Gapless Playback
- Crossfade support

#### Other:

- Artist View
- Optional network features (ex: Musicbrainz integration for automatic metadata)
- Genres
- Shuffle options
- Basic Keybinds
- Flatpak release!

#### Completed:

- ~~[ ! ] Replace current playlist implementation with m3u~~
- ~~Playlist updates: Allow M3U import from inside app, allow custom cover art, delete playlists from inside app~~
- ~~Localization update~~

## Translators

[Fluent][fluent] is used for localization of the software. Fluent's translation files are found in
the [i18n directory](./i18n). New translations may copy the [English (en) localization](./i18n/en) of the project,
rename `en` to the desired [ISO 639-1 language code][iso-codes], and then translations can be provided for
each [message identifier][fluent-guide]. If no translation is necessary, the message may be omitted.

## Packaging

If packaging for a Linux distribution, vendor dependencies locally with the `vendor` rule, and build with the vendored
sources using the `build-vendored` rule. When installing files, use the `rootdir` and `prefix` variables to change
installation paths.

```sh
just vendor
just build-vendored
just rootdir=debian/nova-music prefix=/usr install
```

It is recommended to build a source tarball with the vendored dependencies, which can typically be done by running
`just vendor` on the host system before it enters the build environment.

## Developers

Developers should install [rustup][rustup] and configure their editor to use [rust-analyzer][rust-analyzer]. To improve
compilation times, disable LTO in the release profile, install the [mold][mold] linker, and configure [sccache][sccache]
for use with Rust. The [mold][mold] linker will only improve link times if LTO is disabled.
